To start this project off I tried to follow the diagram on the given PDF file to the best of my ability, trying to connect the spefic wires to the arduino and to the battery. 
I took the time to try and colour code the wires to make things look easier 
(red connects to positive, black connects to negative, grey is for ground, yellow connects to 5V on arduino, etc.). 
Arranging the wires neatly also helped with the organization. 

Once that was done I tried to initialize all the variables and set up the whole project in the code, which went well since that was the basic stuff. 
Through looking at the arduino website with all the references I was able to figure out (more or less) how you stop and start the motors. 
When I ran it, it was working fine, and the motors were running like they were supposed to. 
I added a loop that relates to speed to see if it works. It did not and I am not sure why. 
Then I just decided to connect the potentiometer to the ardiuno and breadboard and try to work with that. 
That just made things much more complicated. Also, I knew that I had to initialize the DIP switch and set it to INPUT-PULLUP and probably use some if statements to make it work, 
but I did not have time to learn to do all that. 

I didn't have time to finish and have it actually work since this week I have all my exams to study for, so i'm sorry I didn't get to finish the entire thing. 
Right now I have just gotten the set up circuit and a few lines of code to get me started.  
Moving forward I should try and focus on practicing with the coding aspect to familiarize myself with how ardiuno works, but it was a fun challenge nonetheless.
